# TileIconify
Creates tiles for (now practically all!) Windows 8.1 (Largely untested) and Windows 10 (Build 10586 and above) Start Menu icons.


Version 2.0 brings the ability to create custom shortcuts. This creates VBS files to launch practically anything you want, which you can then TileIconify like any other shortcut.

Steam integration has been added, but is largely experimental. It *should* detect all installed games and gather their relevant icons, and seems to work on my system, but please raise an issue should you have any problems and I'll look into it.
